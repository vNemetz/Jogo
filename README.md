2D platformer game developed in **C++** using the **SFML Graphics Library**.  
The project uses **CMake** for build automation.  
It was created as part of a university course on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

Made by Gabriel Borges Caballero and Vin√≠cius Nemetz Grabovski.

The software strongly utilises design patterns based on the book "Design Patterns" -  Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson.

All the code written here was entirely engineered by the authors.
